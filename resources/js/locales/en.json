Mery contributes in raising the cultural awareness of employers and House Helper through educational, awareness and motivational programs to increase the rate of career stability.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Our work</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As an employer you can register and browse thousands of House helper profiles, and look for the right helper for your house needs and review the assessment and build confidence with the House Helper before starting recruitment process.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a house helper, you can register and review the profile of employers and start chatting with them to find a family that suits your aspirations and your desire and get a job for free.</span></p>",
